      <description>I have been working in IT and technical communication since 2008.
My first job was at my University, where I worked as a part-time technician, documenting educational projects and events and supporting some IT systems. I also worked as a part-time software developer during my university days.
After graduation, I joined the All-Russian Research Institute for Civil Defense and Emergencies as a post-graduate. I had my postgraduate studies, and after obtaining a PhD, I had a chance to start a new department in the same Research institute from scratch.</description>

      <description>I graduated from the greatest technical university of Russia (Bauman Moscow State Technical University) with two degrees:
Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Spacecraft engineering. Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer science. My first choice was a Spacecraft engineering degree, as I desired space exploration and engineering. In my later years at the university, I realized that my true passion is information technology and computer science. That&amp;rsquo;s why I got a second degree from the same university.</description>

      <description>This will be a page with links to multiple examples of my dinest work. Unfortunately, it is not ready yet =D.
You see, most of my current documents are under NDA so I will try and do some test exercises without any confidential materials and publish it here.
But for now I would like to publish a link for one example of my open source contribution.</description>

      <description>This is a very first blog post here. As this site is mostly under construction.
I am trying to create content here as soon as possible. But it is hard to do when all you have is some scraps of time between work and sleep.
As of now I am still working of portal features and looking for a better ways to visualise my experience and education here.
Also have a grand plan for content.</description>
