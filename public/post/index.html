When documentation for an open-source product becomes overly intricate and packed with specifics, we risk losing those readers who may lack the time or motivation to delve deep. Yet, we risk alienating readers and losing their trust by making it less accurate and more engaging. At the heart of good technical writing is the delicate task of weaving together technical accuracy with engaging educational content. It&rsquo;s about finding that sweet spot – where comprehensiveness meets readability, making the reader feel confident and interested, not overwhelmed.</p>
<p>👥 <strong>Understanding the Audience</strong>: A key aspect is knowing your audience. The approach for experienced professionals differs vastly from that for novices. Tailoring the content to meet the reader&rsquo;s expectations and level of understanding without compromising on technical integrity is a skill that develops over time.</p>
<p>🔄 <strong>Feedback and Continuous Improvement</strong>: The process doesn&rsquo;t end at publication. Feedback is a crucial element. Gathering metrics, engaging with the readers, understanding their pain points, and continuously refining the content based on real-world usage make the documentation a living, evolving entity.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Gain trust</strong>: Building trust with your reader is important, especially for tech-savvy audiences like engineers and scientists. Any errors, including inaccurate or outdated information, reduce the trustworthiness of the documentation as a source of truth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the journey of creating good documentation for a sophisticated open-source product is about much more than just documenting facts. It&rsquo;s about inspiring confidence, igniting curiosity, and simplifying complexity. This challenging yet rewarding path continuously teaches the importance of balancing detailed accuracy with engaging storytelling.</p>

						</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>As a technical writer with more than a decade of experience in software development, I&rsquo;ve come to embrace the Docs-as-Code methodology as my preferred approach. This technique, borrowing best practices from software development, transforms the way we handle documentation, treating it much like we do code. It usually involves storing the content in a Git repository as a text file. Our user-facing documentation needs to undergo a building process to create the output format(s) needed: HTML (web page), PDF, <code>.docx</code>, etc.</p>
<p>There are several alternatives to this approach, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word),</li>
<li>Dedicated Technical Writing Software (Adobe FrameMaker, MadCap Flare),</li>
<li>Knowledge Base Management Tools (Confluence, MediaWiki),</li>
<li>Content Management Systems (WordPress, Joomla),</li>
<li>Document Collaboration Platforms (SharePoint, Quip),</li>
<li>In-Code Documentation (Doxygen for code comments).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are my thoughts on the Pros and Cons of the Docs-as-Code approach:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Version Control</strong>: very transparent, reliable, and accountable process of managing version/changes with VCS like Git.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: SMEs (like software engineers) are familiar and experienced with VCS (like Git). The usage of VCS lets us scale the documentation development process to any size of the documentation team.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: features like single sourcing, transparent change history, merging changes, forking, and branching let us preserve the consistency of documentation during any changes. Additionally, splitting content from design enables consistent representation of documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>: a DevOps specialist can set up CI/CD for the documentation building pipeline that will publish updated documentation in any number of formats to any number of platforms from just a single commit. This pipeline can even include automated tests for the documentation content and output.</li>
<li><strong>Single Source of Truth</strong>: maintaining all content in one place, avoiding discrepancies, and having a reliable change process.</li>
<li><strong>Popularity in Open Source</strong>: most tools used in Docs-as-Code are open source, and the approach itself is very popular in open-source documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Open formats</strong>: simple text formats are usually easily converted. No vendor locks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Curve</strong>: requires familiarity with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and a particular lightweight markup language (e.g., Markdown, AsciiDoc), which can be challenging for non-technical contributors.</li>
<li><strong>Overhead</strong>: integrating documentation into the development workflow adds initial setup and maintenance efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Dependency</strong>: relies on specific tools and platforms, which might limit flexibility in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, while Docs-as-Code is not a one-size-fits-all solution, its alignment with agile practices and software development tools, as well as its emphasis on transparency and collaboration, make it a standout choice for software products and projects where documentation may be as dynamic as the software it supports.</p>

						<p>I have been working in IT and technical communication since 2008.</p>
<p>My first job was at my <a href="https://bmstu.ru/">University</a>, where I worked as a part-time technician, documenting educational projects and events and supporting some IT systems. I also worked as a part-time software developer during my university days.</p>
<p>After graduation, I joined the <a href="https://vniigochs.ru/">All-Russian Research Institute for Civil Defense and Emergencies</a> as a post-graduate. I had my postgraduate studies, and after obtaining a PhD, I had a chance to start a new department in the same Research institute from scratch.</p>
<p>After 8 years in the Research institute, I wanted to try some enterprise software development. I didn&rsquo;t want to pursue a software engineering career because I didn&rsquo;t think this craft was interesting enough. Instead, I found that technical communication is much more rewarding and interesting. My years in research provided me with a lot of experience with documentation, a keen eye for detail, and a good understanding of software development life cycle and technologies.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Mail.RU Group (later renamed to the VK) recruited me to join its B2B unit, namely the Tarantool team, as a Senior Technical writer. VK is an IT giant in Russia that has many businesses, including the most popular <a href="https://vk.com/">social network</a> in Russia. We were developing an open-source in-memory transactional database with a built-in application server in Lua, which I was documenting in English and later translating to Russian.</p>
<p>In 2020, I was promoted to the Team Leader of the documentation team for the VK Private Cloud product. That was a time of tremendous professional growth for me. I have recruited and trained my own cross-functional documentation team. I was learning people management, project management, agile methodology, and team management processes.</p>
<p>In 2022, I was promoted to lead a second documentation team. Since then, I have led both Private Cloud and Public Cloud documentation for VK.</p>
<p>Then, I migrated from Russia and was looking for a relocation opportunity in the EU region. I joined the <a href="https://typedb.com/">Vaticle LTD</a> as a Senior Technical Writer to pursue a career in the UK. I&rsquo;m the company&rsquo;s first and only documentation specialist. Now, I work with a great team of very talented and inspired engineers to create the very first <a href="https://typedb.com/philosophy">polymorphic database</a>.</p>
<p>In 2023, I joined the <a href="https://istc.org.uk/">Institute of Scientific and Technical Communications</a>. Now I’m the head of the London Group and organize our monthly meetings.</p>

						<p>I graduated from the greatest technical university of Russia (<a href="https://bmstu.ru/">Bauman Moscow State Technical University</a>) with <strong>two</strong> degrees:</p>
<ol>
<li>Master&rsquo;s degree in Spacecraft engineering.</li>
<li>Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer science.</li>
</ol>
<p>My first choice was a Spacecraft engineering degree, as I desired space exploration and engineering.
In my later years at the university, I realized that my true passion is information technology and computer science.
That&rsquo;s why I got a second degree from the same university.</p>
<p>Right after University, I joined the <a href="https://vniigochs.ru/">All-Russian Research Institute for Civil Defense and Emergencies</a> for my postgraduate studies. That is where I got my third degree:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>PhD in Technology</strong> with a special topic on the Reliability of single emergency number systems in Russia.</li>
</ol>
<p>My career continued with the research institute, as I became a researcher and later a Head of a Research department for Automated systems.</p>

Unfortunately, it is not ready yet =D.</p>
<p>You see, most of my current documents are under NDA so I will try and do some test exercises without any confidential materials and publish it here.</p>
<p>But for now I would like to publish a <a href="https://github.com/tarantool/doc/blame/3c348038efb765f87d2162e0542d3a17092d3c1d/doc/reference/reference_rock/vshard/vshard_architecture.rst">link</a> for one example of my open source contribution.</p>
