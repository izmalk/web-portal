						<p>With my years of experience in software engineering and technical communication I can solve most problems with documentation.</p>
<p>Documentation is a part of User experience. In case of technical audiences it is usually a critical part.</p>
<p>Good technical communication can showcase your product and improve user experience. You want users being able to solve a problem with your product? You&rsquo;d better ensure your product does not create another problem for them. The easier the path for a typical user experience the lesser number of users will find a way to loose the right way, get bad experience and even drop the product with frustration and negative attitude.</p>
<p>Good technical documentation for a sophisticated product requires a lot of engineering. Usually that means spending many hours of work trying to shorten the path, to mark all obstacles and to ensure all kinds of users would be able to follow.
There is no one silver bullet as one requires subject knowledge, writing skills and a lot of user experience debugging practice to provide a universal &ldquo;fit-for-all&rdquo; documents.</p>

						<p>My deepest passion in learning new technologies, products, user experiences. I am eager to learn, whether it&rsquo;s new framework, new hardware architecture or new web-interface.</p>
<p>I am truly happy that my profession is so deeply connected with my hobby. I love doing my job as it lets me keep learning new technologies and helping other people.</p>
<p>I have started learning programming languages in school. But I always looked for something more to learn â€” not only Pascal, but also Windows OS administration, hardware, networks.</p>
<p>My very first job was intern junior software developer. It was part-time job while studying in University. And while working I understood three things:</p>
<p>. It&rsquo;s kinda fun learning and exploring.
. It&rsquo;s kinda boring just using same technologies over and over again to solve similar tasks.
. My mind was changing to something more like a compiler. The more I was thinking of the code and debugging the more I was concerned of changes in my thought processes.</p>
<p>So I have decided that I don&rsquo;t want to be a full-time software developer. And instead I will look for some other IT related profession.</p>
<p>Since then I have tried being system administrator, analyst, QA, researcher, technical writer and team leader. With the former two being the best suitable professions for me.</p>

						<p>I had two chances to lead a team in my life. And both times I have created from scratch cross-functional teams of highly-skilled professionals that I can be proud of.</p>
<p>After receiving a PhD in Technology I have got my first team as a Head of research department in Information and communication center of the Research institute. I had to build my own research team for automated systems design. I have achieved such a good results building a team of IT professionals and building a test lab infrastructure that some time later I have been assigned as head of IT department of the Institute. While staying as a head of research department I have managed both system administrators and researchers. That was very interesting experience for me. I had a chance to participate both in scientific projects and help people practically, both times being tasked with dealing with IT problems. That period of time was very important for my development as a multi-spectrum specialist and a good manager.</p>
<p>Me second chance to lead a team happened in my current workplace when I was asked to form a new documentation team for VK Cloud Solutions (Mail.Ru Cloud Solutions at that time). I have been working in the company for more than a year already. This was a great chance for me not only build a new team from scratch but also improve upon my leadership skills in an Agile environment. My previous experience was in classic management (also called a Waterfall method). Since then I have created and managed a team of 11 professionals in different areas (5 technical writers, 4 analysts, 1 QA and 1 DocOps specialist). I have established effective processes with regular (daily, weekly and monthly) meetings, short-term (one sprint) and mid-term (1-3 months) planing, sprint retrospectives, style guide discussions and regular feedback exchange.</p>
<p>Also now I am the leader of the Technical writer&rsquo;s guild in my company. It is a professional group with regular (bi weekly) internal meetups and discussions for experience exchange.</p>
