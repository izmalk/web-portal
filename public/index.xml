      <title>Lightweight Markup Languages for Docs-as-Code</title>

      <description>In the innovative landscape of technical writing, the Docs-as-Code approach revolutionizes how we create, manage, and publish documentation. Central to this paradigm shift are three lightweight markup languages: Markdown, reStructuredText, and AsciiDoc. Each brings its unique strengths to the forefront, enabling seamless integration of documentation into the software development workflow.
Markdown stands out for its simplicity and widespread adoption. From GitHub repositories to blogging platforms, its straightforward syntax ensures that documentation is easily readable by humans and machines alike, making it the go-to choice for quick, effective content creation.</description>

      <description>üìù‚ú® In the world of sophisticated open-source products, we often find ourselves walking a tightrope between two seemingly conflicting goals: crafting comprehensive and accurate documentation and ensuring that it‚Äôs engaging and inspiring for our readers. This balancing act presents a unique set of challenges that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate in my journey as a technical writer.
üîç Precision vs. Engagement: The core challenge lies in presenting technical information in a precise, comprehensive, yet captivating way.</description>

      <title>Embracing the Docs-as-Code Approach in Software Documentation</title>

      <description>As a technical writer with more than a decade of experience in software development, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to embrace the Docs-as-Code methodology as my preferred approach. This technique, borrowing best practices from software development, transforms the way we handle documentation, treating it much like we do code. It usually involves storing the content in a Git repository as a text file. Our user-facing documentation needs to undergo a building process to create the output format(s) needed: HTML (web page), PDF, .</description>

      <description>I have been working in IT and technical communication since 2008.
My first job was at my University, where I worked as a part-time technician, documenting educational projects and events and supporting some IT systems. I also worked as a part-time software developer during my university days.
After graduation, I joined the All-Russian Research Institute for Civil Defense and Emergencies as a post-graduate. I had my postgraduate studies, and after obtaining a PhD, I had a chance to start a new department in the same Research institute from scratch.</description>

      <description>I graduated from the greatest technical university of Russia (Bauman Moscow State Technical University) with two degrees:
Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Spacecraft engineering. Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer science. My first choice was a Spacecraft engineering degree, as I desired space exploration and engineering. In my later years at the university, I realized that my true passion is information technology and computer science. That&amp;rsquo;s why I got a second degree from the same university.</description>

      <description>This will be a page with links to multiple examples of my dinest work. Unfortunately, it is not ready yet =D.
You see, most of my current documents are under NDA so I will try and do some test exercises without any confidential materials and publish it here.
But for now I would like to publish a link for one example of my open source contribution.</description>
