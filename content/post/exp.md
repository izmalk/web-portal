I have been in Documentation since 2011.

Started as a junior researcher in All-Russian Research Institute of Civil Defence and Emergencies (VNII GOChS for short).

I had my postgraduate studies and after obtaining a PhD degree I had a chance to start a new department from scratch.

In 2019 I got recruited by the VK (Mail.Ru at the time) to join its B2B unit. I joined the Tarantool team as a Senior Technical writer.

In 2020 I got moved and later promoted to the Team Leader of Documentation team for VK Cloud Platform.

In 2022 I left the VK to pursue a career in the UK. I joined the Vaticle as a Senior Technical Writer.
