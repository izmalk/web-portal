I have been working in IT and technical communication since 2008.

My first job was at my [University](https://bmstu.ru/), where I worked as a part-time technician, documenting educational projects and events and supporting some IT systems. I also worked as a part-time software developer during my university days.

After graduation, I joined the [All-Russian Research Institute for Civil Defense and Emergencies](https://vniigochs.ru/) as a post-graduate. I had my postgraduate studies, and after obtaining a PhD, I had a chance to start a new department in the same Research institute from scratch.

After 8 years in the Research institute, I wanted to try some enterprise software development. I didn't want to pursue a software engineering career because I didn't think this craft was interesting enough. Instead, I found that technical communication is much more rewarding and interesting. My years in research provided me with a lot of experience with documentation, a keen eye for detail, and a good understanding of software development life cycle and technologies.

In 2019, the Mail.RU Group (later renamed to the VK) recruited me to join its B2B unit, namely the Tarantool team, as a Senior Technical writer. VK is an IT giant in Russia that has many businesses, including the most popular [social network](https://vk.com/) in Russia. We were developing an open-source in-memory transactional database with a built-in application server in Lua, which I was documenting in English and later translating to Russian.

In 2020, I was promoted to the Team Leader of the documentation team for the VK Private Cloud product. That was a time of tremendous professional growth for me. I have recruited and trained my own cross-functional documentation team. I was learning people management, project management, agile methodology, and team management processes.

In 2022, I was promoted to lead a second documentation team. Since then, I have led both Private Cloud and Public Cloud documentation for VK.

Then, I migrated from Russia and was looking for a relocation opportunity in the EU region. I joined the [Vaticle LTD](https://typedb.com/) as a Senior Technical Writer to pursue a career in the UK. I'm the company's first and only documentation specialist. Now, I work with a great team of very talented and inspired engineers to create the very first [polymorphic database](https://typedb.com/philosophy).

In 2023, I joined the [Institute of Scientific and Technical Communications](https://istc.org.uk/). Now Iâ€™m the head of the London Group and organize our monthly meetings.
