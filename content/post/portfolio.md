This will be a page with links to multiple examples of my dinest work.
Unfortunately, it is not ready yet =D.

You see, most of my current documents are under NDA so I will try and do some test exercises without any confidential materials and publish it here.

But for now I would like to publish a [link](https://github.com/tarantool/doc/blame/3c348038efb765f87d2162e0542d3a17092d3c1d/doc/reference/reference_rock/vshard/vshard_architecture.rst) for one example of my open source contribution.
