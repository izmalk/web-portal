I provide free mentorship for aspiring and motivated technical writers of all seniority levels.

You can book a session for free on [ADPlist](https://adplist.org/mentors/vladimir).
I use this platform to manage my calendar and booking.

Before you book a slot, consider the following information:

* All mentorship is completely free.
* All mentorship is done by me personally.
* Please respect my time and effort: I'm not here to work instead of you.
  You will be doing the work, and I will be guiding you.
  The work can be your real-life documentation-related work,
  or just working on improving yourself and your public profile.
* This can be a single mentorship session if you have specific questions
or want to try whether mentorship works for you.
* However, I recommend considering one of the following specialized mentorship programs.

Everything is completely free of charge but will require some time and effort
commitment from both you and me.

For that reason, before enrolling into a mentorship programme,
you need to check that you meet the following common and specific prerequisites,
and then book a screening call (one hour) with me
via [ADPlist](https://adplist.org/mentors/vladimir).

The mentorship sessions are booked in advance outside of ADPlist
for those who are selected to join one of the programs.

For all the programs below, the following common prerequisites are required:

* English or Russian language proficiency for working and collaboration:

* Personal computer user skills with any OS: enough to work with files,
  text editors, web browsers, and occasional command line tools.
* Aspiration to work as a technical writer or any other documentation-specific role.
