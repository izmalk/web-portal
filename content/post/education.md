I have two higher educations with the greatest technical university of Russia: **Bauman Moscow State Technical University**.

1. Master's degree in Spaceship engineering.

2. Bachelor's degree in Computer science.

I also have **PhD in Technology** with the study on the reliability of automated systems in emergencies. I got it at All-Russian Research Institute for Civil Defense and Emergencies (or VNII GOChS for short).
