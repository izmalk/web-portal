I graduated from the greatest technical university of Russia ([Bauman Moscow State Technical University](https://bmstu.ru/)) with **two** degrees:

1. Master's degree in Spacecraft engineering.
2. Bachelor's degree in Computer science.

My first choice was a Spacecraft engineering degree, as I desired space exploration and engineering.
In my later years at the university, I realized that my true passion is information technology and computer science.
That's why I got a second degree from the same university.

Right after University, I joined the [All-Russian Research Institute for Civil Defense and Emergencies](https://vniigochs.ru/) for my postgraduate studies. That is where I got my third degree: 

3. **PhD in Technology** with a special topic on the Reliability of single emergency number systems in Russia.

My career continued with the research institute, as I became a researcher and later a Head of a Research department for Automated systems.
