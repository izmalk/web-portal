Geek. Technology evangelist. Curious researcher.

Passionate for learning, teaching and enhancing user experience through a storytelling.

### Work experience

I have been in Documentation since 2011.

Started as a junior researcher in All-Russian Research Institute of Civil Defence and Emergencies (VNII GOChS for short).

I had my postgraduate studies and after obtaining a PhD degree I had a chance to start a new department from scratch.

In 2019 I got recruited by VK (Mail.Ru at the time) to join its B2B unit. I joined the Tarantool team as a Senior Technical writer.

In 2020 I got moved and later promoted to the Team Leader of Documentation team for VK Cloud Platform.

I have two higher educations with the greatest technical university of Russia: **Bauman Moscow State Technical University**.

1. Master's degree in Spaceship engineering.

2. Bachelor's degree in Computer science.

I also have **PhD in Technology** with the study on the reliability of automated systems in emergencies. I got it at All-Russian Research Institute for Civil Defense and Emergencies (or VNII GOChS for short).
