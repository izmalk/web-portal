![about](../images/about_me_light.jpg)

Geek. Technology evangelist. Curious researcher. Documentation engineer.

Passionate for IT, learning, teaching, and improving user experience through storytelling.

### Work experience

I have been working in Documentation since 2011.

Started as a junior researcher at the All-Russian Research Institute of Civil Defence and Emergencies (VNII GOChS for short).

I had my postgraduate studies and after obtaining a PhD, I had a chance to start a new department from scratch.

In 2019 I got recruited by VK (Mail.Ru at the time) to join its B2B unit. I joined the Tarantool team as a Senior Technical writer.

In 2020 I got moved to the Documentation team for the VK Cloud Platform’s Private Cloud product and was later promoted to the Team Leader position. 

In 2021 I got a promotion and was assigned leadership over the VK Cloud Platform’s main product documentation team.

In 2022 I had to leave my native country, so I moved to Turkey and started looking for international opportunities with relocation. I landed a job at Vaticle LTD to work as the first Technical writer in a team of talented software engineers in their office in London, United Kingdom.

### Education

I have two higher educations with the greatest technical university in Russia: **Bauman Moscow State Technical University**.

1. Master's degree in Spaceship Engineering.

2. Bachelor's degree in Computer science.

While working at the All-Russian Research Institute for Civil Defense and Emergencies (or VNII GOChS) I got a scientific degree of Candidate of Technical Sciences, which is roughly equal to a **Ph.D. in Technology**. My thesis was on the reliability of single emergency number systems, implemented in the Russian Federation.

According to the International Standard Classification of Education, for purposes of international educational statistics, Kandidat Nauk (Candidate of Sciences) belongs to ISCED level 8, or "doctoral or equivalent", together with PhD, DPhil, DLitt, DSc, LLD, Doctorate, or similar. It is mentioned in the Russian version of ISCED 2011 (par.262) on the UNESCO website as an equivalent to PhD belonging to this level.
