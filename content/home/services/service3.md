My deepest passion in learning new technologies, products, user experiences. I am eager to learn, whether it's new framework, new hardware architecture or new web-interface.

I am truly happy that my profession is so deeply connected with my hobby. I love doing my job as it lets me keep learning new technologies and helping other people.

I have started learning programming languages in school. But I always looked for something more to learn â€” not only Pascal, but also Windows OS administration, hardware, networks.

My very first job was intern junior software developer. It was part-time job while studying in University. And while working I understood three things:

. It's kinda fun learning and exploring.
. It's kinda boring just using same technologies over and over again to solve similar tasks.
. My mind was changing to something more like a compiler. The more I was thinking of the code and debugging the more I was concerned of changes in my thought processes.

So I have decided that I don't want to be a full-time software developer. And instead I will look for some other IT related profession.

Since then I have tried being system administrator, analyst, QA, researcher, technical writer and team leader. With the former two being the best suitable professions for me.
