With my years of experience in software engineering and technical communication I can solve most problems with documentation.

Documentation is a part of User experience. In case of technical audiences it is usually a critical part.

Good technical communication can showcase your product and improve user experience. You want users being able to solve a problem with your product? You'd better ensure your product does not create another problem for them. The easier the path for a typical user experience the lesser number of users will find a way to loose the right way, get bad experience and even drop the product with frustration and negative attitude.

Good technical documentation for a sophisticated product requires a lot of engineering. Usually that means spending many hours of work trying to shorten the path, to mark all obstacles and to ensure all kinds of users would be able to follow.
There is no one silver bullet as one requires subject knowledge, writing skills and a lot of user experience debugging practice to provide a universal "fit-for-all" documents.
